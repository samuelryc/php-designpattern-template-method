# PHP Template Design Pattern

Just a repository showing an example of the PHP Template Method Design Pattern.

### Official description

    The template method pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the program skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. It lets one redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.
